## D. Outside The Box Questions

The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing impression!

### 1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

Growth can be calculated by determining the increase in number of customers or revenue, on a monthly or annual basis.

### 2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?

- Number of customers
- Number of customer per plan type (trial, monthly, pro)
- Number of customers converted to pay plans
- Revenue
- Revenue per customer
- Revenue per plan type
- Number of new customers
- Churn


### 3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?

It would be interesting to analyze the plan types that customers progress through, and the time they spend in each plan type. For example, how many trial customers are converted into each paid plan type, and how long to they spend under a monthly or annual plan? Are customers downgrading from a pro plan, or are they churning and leaving the subscription service altogether?

Analyzing these customer journeys will give insight into how attractive the plans are to current customers, and help improve the plans to attract new customers. For example, if customers are often downgrading from a pro plan, then that is a sign that it is not offering enough value from a customers perspective, and so that product offering should be improved.

This analysis could be combined with customer demographics and service usage metrics, if available, to provide further detail.

### 4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?

Example Questions:

1. What is the reason for your cancellation?
    - Cost
    - I do not need a subscription any more
    - Foodie-fi is too complicated

2. Did we meet your expectations?
    - Yes
    - No

3. If we did not meet your expectations, please tell us why?

4. What would you like to see improved in Foodie-Fi?

### 5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?

Possible options:

- Targeted marketing of paid plans toward trial customers
- Loyalty program, discounts, or incentives towards converting to a paid plan

The effectiveness of these options can be validated with A/B testing or customer cohort analysis.
